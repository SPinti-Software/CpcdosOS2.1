The NICSCAN.EXE program is a utility which scans the PCI bus for a network card, 
reads its vendor and device ID and then looks up in the pci.dbn file the name
of the vendor and the device, if present in this file.

The interupt used by NICSCAN is not available in a Windows DOS box, so it cannot
be used then. Also it will not work with the new NVIDIA netbus.

NICSCAN shall help you to determine which packet driver you need for your PC.
