                   UMBPCI.SYS v3.x - English Release
	=========================================================



Most of this doc has been written in 1998. Many part a no more updated since
many years.



OVERVIEW
========

UMBPCI.SYS is a FREEware MS-DOS 5.00 and higher Upper Memory Area (UMA) access
driver (MS HIMEM.SYS extender) for Intel, FIC VIA (Apollo), ALi (Aladdin) and
SiS PCI/AGP chipsets, supporting Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III, AMD and
Cyrix CPUs. It may work with DR-DOS, Novell DOS, Caldera Open DOS but this is
untested.

It is based on the German c't Magazine's free source code:
http://www.heise.de/ct/
The original UMBPCI (German version):
ftp://ftp.heise.de/pub/ct/ctsi/umbpci.zip
was written by c't Magazine's editor Andreas Stiller in 1995, based on UMBADD
developed by Peter Siering (c't Magazine) in 1991.
UMBPCI had several problems, supported only Intel chipsets up to the 430FX,
and there were no free updates. Andreas further developed CTUMB, which is
only available to c't subscribers, on c't Magazine's Utilities CD-ROM.

NOTE: UMBPCI.SYS is an unofficial release, unsupported by c't Magazine!

FEATURES + ADVANTAGES
=====================

UMBPCI.SYS extends Microsoft's HIMEM.SYS by enabling the "Request XMS-UMB"
function. Microsoft's EMM386.EXE does the same, when loaded with the "NOEMS",
"HIGHSCAN" or "RAM" parameters in CONFIG.SYS.

UMBPCI.SYS creates UMBs (Upper Memory Blocks) using the existing system memory
intended to be used as Shadow RAM, but disabled by default, ONLY in the
C800-EFFF range, NOT at B000-B7FF. The B000-B7FF area is normally used for
monochrome video (used by older graphics adapters), NOT for BIOS (ROM)
extensions, therefore X86 chipsets cannot enable shadow RAM within this
region. UMBPCI.SYS enables this memory and disables its write protection.

UMBPCI.SYS takes ONLY 160 Bytes of conventional RAM (144 Bytes code + 16 Bytes
environment), while providing up to 629 KiloBytes (KB) of FREE conventional
(low) memory (RAM), IF loading ALL devices/drivers/TSRs "high"!

Microsoft EMM386.EXE creates UMBs from the computer's physical XMS
(eXtended Memory Specifications) by virtually remapping XMS to the upper
memory area using the Memory Management Unit (MMU) of 386 and higher CPUs.
It needs additional 150 KB of XMS, 4 KB of low memory and 7 KB of UMA
(Upper Memory Area) when loaded, and it also switches the CPU into "protected
mode" (slower) because it's necessary to use the MMU. DOS runs in virtual 8086
maschine then (V86 mode).
UMBPCI.SYS leaves the CPU in "real mode", for better compatibility and faster
performance.

Begining with v3.00 you can simply try loading UMBPCI without any checking.
Because UMBPCI.SYS is an extension to HIMEM.SYS under MS-DOS/MS Windows, it
MUST be loaded after HIMEM.SYS. CONFIG.SYS example assuming Win9x is in
C:\WINDOWS and UMBPCI.SYS in C:\UMBPCI:

DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS
DEVICEHIGH=...
INSTALLHIGH=...
SET=...
etc...

If properly loaded, you'll see a message like this:

"UMBPCI c't 11/95 - Siering/Schaepers/Stiller
V3.05 - support for new Intel/VIA/ALi/SIS chipsets + P2 - Uwe Sieber 08/99
Using C800-EFFF
Intel 440BX/ZX found
Programm installed"

If your chipset is NOT supported, you'll get this message:

"No supported chipset found.
Problem programming the chipset."

And if your chipset is supported but UNTESTED, you'll get this message:

"This chipset is untested! Mail me the name of the chipset and if it works
so I can remove this break: uwe.sieber@gmx.de
press any key..."

I'll remove this pause screen as soon as I know if your (untested) chipset
works.

If you get other messages please e-mail me.
You can determine your chipset's brand/type by using this program:

TOOLS
=====

Freeware tools included with UMBPCI.SYS:

1. UMBCHK.EXE

UMBCHK is needed ONLY if you want to use UMBPCI's /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter.

Reboot your computer WITHOUT processing the startup files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS): press F8 during the bootup routine (MS-DOS 6.xx or Windows 9x).
This is similar with the "Command prompt only" option from the Windows 9x
Startup Menu. Go to this page for more details:
http://members.aol.com/axcel216/msdos.htm#MEN
Then run UMBCHK to view all upper memory ranges available to UMBPCI, and to
display the suggested command line for use with UMBPCI. UMBCHK recommends the
same ranges UMBPCI uses when loaded without parameter.
If UMBCHK suggests /I=C800-EFFF, add this line to your CONFIG.SYS file, AFTER
the HIMEM.SYS line (example):

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=C800-EFFF

If you take a quick look at UMBPCI's message, you won't need UMBCHK.

UMBCHK and UMBPCI's /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter are NOT needed by UMBPCI v3.00 and
newer, which autodetect and map the available UMBs.


2. DMACHK.COM

I added DMACHK thanks to Heiko Nocon who made it possible.

Use DMACHK to check and display the UMB ranges in which ISA DMA works,
eventually redirecting its output to a text file. Example:

drive:\path\DMACHK > drive:\path\UMBRANGE.TXT

To use it UMBPCI MUST be loaded.
DMACHK may crash some maschines - no idea why.


3. UMBFILL.COM

Windows 9x takes over all remaining UMBs (not used by drivers or TSRs) and
uses them as normal memory. But the memory created by UMBPCI is sometimes not
seen as "normal" by MS-DOS/MS Windows. It may not be cacheable and/or ISA DMA
may not work. With the exception of the very first Intel PCI chipsets, the
only really normal UMBs UMBPCI creates, are at E000-EFFF on Intel chipsets up
to the 440xX and the UMBs of the VIA Apollo P2 chipsets.
To prevent Windows 9x from using this remaining critical memory in such cases,
use UMBFILL to allocate ALL remaining UMBs before Windows 9x GUI loads.
Add a UMBFILL line, AFTER ALL your devices/drivers/TSRs lines, and BEFORE the
line that starts Windows in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, If you load Windows from
AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Another way to prevent Win9x from taking over all remaining UMBs is to add the
LocalLoadHigh=0 line under your SYSTEM.INI's [386enh] section.
Then Win9x occupies only a small part of the UMBs which seem to be uncritical.

Thanks Christian Masloch for the new UMBFILL.



4. LOWDMA

LOWDMA is a driver for handling floppy disk sectors in non-DMA UMB. See 
LOWDMA.TXT for more information. It seems to have problems with complex
directory structures (usually not found on boot disks...).




RESTRICTIONS
============


Power Management
----------------

Suspend to RAM or Disk doesn't work with UMBPCI. I think the UMBs created by UMBPCI
aren't saved and restored by the power management because it doesn't know
UMBPCI.


PCI busmastering
-------------------

PCI busmastering doesn't work on AMD K7 CPUs (Athlon, Duron).

This technique is used by PCI IDE controller with their one BIOS, known from
Promise, Highpoint, Silicon Image and others, some AMI BIOSses and XDMA/QDMA drivers
from http://johnson.tmfc.net/freedos/qdma.html


Sometimes it helps to set DoubleBuffer=1 in the MSDOS.SYS of Windows 95 or
higher (= MS-DOS 7.x).

On elder DOS versions you cannot load high drivers and programs from a Harddisk
that is plugged on a contoller that uses PCI busmastering in pure DOS. That is
similar to the problem with ISA DMA.



ISA DMA
----------------


ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) DMA (Direct Memory Access) is critical in
the created UMBs. ISA involves ANY 8-bit ISA expansion cards you might have on
your computer (modem, sound card, network card etc), and the Floppy Drive
Controller (FDC). A typical PC/AT IBM compatible clone has one (primary, 3.5",
1.44 MB, drive letter A, default bootable drive), or two (secondary, 5.25",
1.2 MB, drive letter B, optional) floppy drives.
Such devices MUST use the DMA controller (built into the motherboard chipset),
thus relieving the CPU of time consuming routine tasks (requiring extra CPU
cycles), so your processor can proceed with other operations at the same time
(multitasking).

* KNOWN PROBLEMS + SOLUTIONS [depending on your motherboard chipset type]:

1. The ISA DMA function might NOT be possible in certain UMA regions, because
the memory UMBPCI uses is intended as shadow RAM, NOT as normal RAM. This has
nothing to do with PCI Bus Mastering.

2. Level 2 (L2) CPU cache may be write-protected so UMBPCI cannot make the
UMBs cacheable (non Intel Socket-7 chipsets)

Win9x loads high memory blocks depending to the CONFIG.SYS switches buffers,
files, lastdrive, stacks ...

To force Win9x to load them into low memory, you can use the DOS=NOAUTO switch.
But then Win9x doesn't load the IFSHLP.SYS driver that is needed for Win9x.

Try this:

files=50
buffers=20
stacks=9,256
dos=high, umb, noauto
device=c:\windows\ifshlp.sys
device=c:\windows\himem.sys
device=umbpci.sys
devicehigh=...
installhigh=...


3. There are reports about crashes involving CMOS/BIOS corruption on some
Compaq Presarios. Maybe the reason was simply a wrong parameter, but I have no
further information.

4. Some USB (Universal Serial Bus) keyboards use the C800-CBFF area, therefore
you need to restrict UMBPCI.SYS to the CC00-EFFF region in CONFIG.SYS, when
using the /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter (example):

DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=CC00-EFFF

5. No program that needs ISA DMA should be loaded high, especially disk
(floppy) cache TSRs (Terminate and Stay Resident programs) like Microsoft
SMARTDRV.EXE. But you can use the /L parameter with SMARTDRV to force it to
load partially into conventional memory, with LOADHIGH in AUTOEXEC.BAT, or
INSTALLHIGH in CONFIG.SYS. The result will be a "splitted load", exactly
what UMBPCI.SYS needs. In this case SMARTDRV takes 16384 Bytes of low memory:

LOADHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV 2048 16 /L

which can be reduced by using the /B:xxxx and /E:xxxx parameter. The default
values are /B:16384 /E:8192 which causes SMARTDRV takes 16384 Bytes of low
memory in the example above.

For absolute minimum memory usage but a little disk performance loss in real
DOS mode, you can combine the /B and /E parameter:

LOADHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV 2048 16 /B:2048 /E:1024 /L

This takes only 2 KB of low and about 16 KB of upper memory.

The B(uffer) value must be a multiple of the E(lement) value. Do NOT use
the same value for /E: and /B: ! This can cause sporadic data errors!


1024 is a bit extreme and prevents SMARTDRV caches CDROMs because
a sector on a CDROM has 2048 Bytes. /B:4096 /E:2048 should be a
good compromise.

Using these parameters can cause data errors on large FAT32 drives.
Make a
dir xxxx.* /s 
from the root directory. If there is a problem you will get an error 
message like 'Error in the directory structure'.


You can also disable the SMARTDRV floppy cache by adding the A- and B-
parameters (depending on how many floppy drives you have), or by loading
SMARTDRV into the upper memory E segment [E000-EFFF], if you have an Intel
430xX or 440xX chipset (tricky). Example of SMARTDRV line in AUTOEXEC.BAT:

LOADHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV 2048 16 A- B- C+ D /N

to disable read and write caching on both floppy drives (A and B), enable
read and write caching on the hard drive (C), and enable read-only caching on
the CD-ROM/DVD drive (D).

Another way to force SMARTDRV to load into the E segment (ONLY IF you have an
Intel 430xx or 440xx chipset), at least at E000-E3FF, is to load MSCDEX
(MicroSoft Compact Disk EXtensions) with LOADHIGH, BEFORE the SMARTDRV
line in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

NOTE: You also need to load your DOS mode cd-rom/dvd (supplied) driver in
CONFIG.SYS, if you want to have your cd-rom/dvd available in native MS-DOS,
AND to have it cached by SMARTDRV the same time. Example:

DEVICEHIGH=C:\CDROM\CDROM.SYS /D:MYCDROM

In case SMARTDRV loads partially at E000 or below E000, the floppy disk
becomes UNREADABLE, IF the read/write floppy cache is enabled by SMARTDRV's
A+ and/or B+ switches!

NOTE: QCDROM is an "universal" CD-ROM/DVD DOS driver, free from
http://johnson.tmfc.net/freedos/
and works with most popular IDE/ATAPI internal cd-rom/dvd drives.

There is a replacement for MSCDEX too: SHSUCDX
http://johnson.tmfc.net/freedos/


Example of MSCDEX v2.25 and SMARTDRV v5.02 "combo" in AUTOEXEC.BAT, using MS
Windows 9x:

LOADHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE /D:MYCDROM /M:16
LOADHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 2048 16 A+ B+ C+ D /N

to force SMARTDRV to load at E000, and occupy the UMA at and above E3FF.

Another method is to create two UMB regions, by adding this line in CONFIG.SYS:

DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=C800-DFFF /I=E000-EFFF

Then you can choose to load a program in one of the 2 created regions: #1
(C800-DFFF) or #2 (E000-EFFF), by using the /L:x parameter (example):

LOADHIGH /L:2 C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV 2048 16 A+ B+ C+ D /N

This places SMARTDRV into the second region which starts at E000.

BTW: INSTALLHIGH doesn't support the /L:x parameter. Ask Microsoft why...

These are the ONLY ways I found to make floppy cache possible, other than
restricting UMBPCI's available UMA to E000-EFFF (example):

DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=E000-EFFF

which defeats the purpose of using UMBPCI.SYS for providing as much UMA as
possible.

TIP: MSCDEX provides support for accessing CD-ROM/DVD drives in native DOS
mode. Run MSCDEX /? from the true MS-DOS prompt to display its command line
switches.

Observe also the different DOS (2048) and Windows (16) SMARTDRV cache sizes
(in KiloBytes). You want to allocate a large SMARTDRV cache in native/true
MS-DOS mode (but not more than 1/6 of your installed memory, especially if you
only have 16 MB or less), and the smallest SMARTDRV cache size in Windows,
because Windows 9x and WfWG 3.1x provide their own 32-bit protected mode
virtual cache algorhythms, and do NOT need SMARTDRV to cache ANY drives.

Observe also the /N switch, which allows the return to the DOS prompt BEFORE
SMARTDRV's temporary memory cache buffer is flushed and data permanently
written to disk. Use /N with CAUTION, because you may experience DATA LOSS in
case of a sudden power outage!
SMARTDRV's buffer loads into the UMA in the example above, using the MS-DOS
built-in LOADHIGH command.
But if an upper memory manager (like EMM386, QEMM, NetRoom, 386MAX etc)
enables access to the UMA, SMARTDRV doesn't need LOADHIGH (or a similar 3rd
party "loader"), being capable of placing itself in the upper memory if it
can fit into a free contiguous UMB.

TIPS:
- Run:
SMARTDRV /?
from any DOS prompt to display all available command line parameters.

7. If loading UMBPCI from a bootable floppy disk, you should ONLY use UMA
ranges that can handle ISA-DMA. E.g. on newer Intel chipsets (430xX, 440xX)
load it with /I=E000-EFFF.
Do NOT load UMBPCI from boot disks on chipsets that cannot handle ISA-DMA
in the UMBs!

8. To fix all the problems with ISA DMA you can try the LOWDMA driver. See
LOWDMA.TXT for more information.

USAGE GUIDELINES
================

If you want to use UMBPCI's /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter, make sure to check the free
UMA before loading UMBPCI.SYS, by running UMBCHK (see the "TOOLS" section
above).

To visualize the DOS memory allocation the MEM command is certainly not of
prime quality. :( I suggest using MI.COM [9 KB, freeware]:
http://www.uwe-sieber.de/files/mi_e.zip
MI stands probably for Memory Information.

If you use EMM386.EXE, you can "borrow" its /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter(s) for use
with UMBPCI.SYS v2.24 and older ONLY (UMBPCI v3.00 and newer do NOT need the
/I=xxxx-yyyy parameter), but this MUST be limited to the range C800-EFFF, which
is valid for ALL UMBPCI releases.
After adding a line for UMBPCI.SYS to your CONFIG.SYS, disable the EMM386.EXE
line by placing REM or a semicolon (;) in front of it. Examples:

; DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE I=B000-B7FF RAM D=256 AUTO

or:

REM DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE I=B000-B7FF RAM D=256 AUTO

If you don't want to use UMBPCI's /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter (needed ONLY if you
want to enable EMS) you can skip to the following section: "ADDITIONAL OS
COMPATIBILITY".

UMBPCI.SYS accepts and recognizes only the I=xxxx-yyyy command line switch
preceeded by a forward slash (/), which MUST be used with UMBPCI v2.24 and
older. UMBPCI supports multiple /I=xxxx-yyyy parameters.
UMBPCI uses ONLY contiguous 16 KB Upper Memory Blocks. You may have to
increase the start address or decrease the end address to the nearest 16 KB
border for UMBPCI.SYS to operate properly!

In MSD's Memory chart (displayed by pressing M at the MSD main screen), look
at your upper memory range. Every caret (square) stands for 1 KB of memory,
therefore each entire line stands for 16 KB. Because UMBPCI.SYS can use ONLY
whole (contiguous) free 16 KB blocks, you have to look for lines that are
COMPLETELY available (unused).

MSD.EXE is the MS-DOS based MicroSoft Diagnostics utility (included with
MS-DOS 6.xx and Windows 3.1x/9x), that you might need one day (hope not...) to
see how your System, Memory, Devices, TSRs, Video, Mouse, Disks, Ports etc...
are configured, and to detect eventual hardware conflicts: IRQ (Interrupt
ReQuest line), BA (hex Base Address), I/O (Input/Output) Port, COMx Port etc.

* MSD.EXE v2.14 is located on the Win98 Setup CD-ROM, in the \TOOLS\OLDMSDOS
folder.
* MSD.EXE v2.13 is located on the Win95 Setup CD-ROM, in the \OTHER\MSD
folder.
* MSD.EXE v3.0 (MS-DOS 6.00 - 6.22 users) is located in your \DOS directory
(default is C:\DOS). If you can't find it, extract it (using EXPAND.EXE) from
your MS-DOS 6.xx Install floppies, and place it into your DOS directory.

Users of MS-DOS 5.00 - 6.21 can download the updated MSD.EXE v2.11 [180 KB,
free], also included with MS-DOS 6.22:
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/GA0363.EXE

MSD.EXE is NOT installed by Windows 9x Setup by default! Copy MSD.EXE manually
from your Win9x Setup CD-ROM to a folder in your path (I recommend
\WINDOWS\COMMAND), or run it directly from your Win9x CD-ROM:

MSD

at any DOS prompt.

HINT: Try first to run MSD from outside the Windows GUI, in native MS-DOS
mode, by choosing to boot with the "Command prompt only" option from the
Windows 9x Startup Menu:
- Option 5 on Win9x maschines without a Network and/or TCP/IP protocol
installed, or:
- Option 6 on Win9x Networked systems and/or TCP/IP enabled,
to see what lies under your PC's "hood".

When deciding which lines to use with the UMBPCI.SYS /I=xxxx-yyyy parameter,
take the starting upper memory address from the left side of the lowest line
and the end address from the right side of the highest line, as shown on your
MSD's memory screen.

Your Windows 9x (typically installed in C:\WINDOWS) CONFIG.SYS file should
look something like this, assuming the entire UMB area is contiguous and free:

DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /TESTMEM:OFF /Q
DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=C800-EFFF
DEVICEHIGH=...
INSTALLHIGH=...
SET=...
etc...

You MUST place HIMEM.SYS in CONFIG.SYS (using the DEVICE command), because
UMBPCI.SYS is an extension to HIMEM.SYS. Windows 9x loads HIMEM.SYS
automatically, but later in the sequence. Therefore the HIMEM.SYS command MUST
be loaded BEFORE UMBPCI.SYS!

EMM386.EXE is no longer needed, unless you need Expanded Memory (EMS) for
running DOS applications/games.
If you DO need EMS, you MUST reserve 64 KB of contiguous upper memory for the
EMS Page Frame, and place the EMM386.EXE DEVICE line AFTER UMBPCI.SYS in your
CONFIG.SYS.
Also, you MUST exclude the contiguous Upper Memory Region (UMR) used by
EMM386.EXE's Page Frame from UMBPCI's /I=xxxx-yyyy range. This 64 KB area is
located by default between addresses C800-D7FF. EMM386.EXE tries to place its
Page Frame in this region upon loading. You can also force EMM386.EXE to "fit"
its Page Frame into the C800-D7FF region by adding the Mx switch on the
EMM386.EXE line (M3 in this case), ONLY IF this area is NOT used by ROM/BIOS.
Example of such CONFIG.SYS lines, combining UMBPCI.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
provide EMS, and to load all devices/TSRs "high" the same time:

DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /TESTMEM:OFF /Q
DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=D800-EFFF
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE X=D800-EFFF X=B800-C7FF I=C800-D7FF I=B000-B7FF RAM M3 D=256 AUTO
DEVICEHIGH=...
INSTALLHIGH=...
SET=...
etc...


If you VGA card has a 48K BIOS (e.g. NVidea GeForce) you cannot use C800-CBFF.
Try this then:

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /TESTMEM:OFF /Q
DEVICE=C:\UMBPCI\UMBPCI.SYS /I=DC00-EFFF
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE X=DC00-EFFF X=B800-C7FF I=CC00-DBFF I=B000-B7FF RAM M3 D=256 AUTO



IMPORTANT: To become familiar with HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE command line
parameters:
- MS Windows 9x users: use Notepad to read the "HIMEM.SYS" and "EMM386.EXE"
topics in MSDOSDRV.TXT, a text file located in your Windows folder.
- MS-DOS 6.xx users: run these commands from any DOS prompt:
HELP HIMEM.SYS
and then:
HELP EMM386.EXE
and read the related topics.

Alternatively you can load EMM386.EXE without a Page Frame by adding the
"FRAME=NONE" parameter to your EMM386.EXE CONFIG.SYS line, while still
providing EMS. Example:

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE FRAME=NONE X=D800-EFFF X=B800-C7FF I=C800-D7FF I=B000-B7FF RAM D=256 AUTO

But BEWARE of program errors, because older EMS DOS programs were not designed
to work properly WITHOUT a Page Frame.

Another method is to reserve the 64 KB Page Frame area and let Windows 9x GUI
provide EMS in its DOS boxes/sessions. This SYSTEM.INI [386enh] section line:

[386enh]
EMMPageFrame=C800

does the trick, provided that the 64 KB upper memory region at C800-D7FF is
CONTIGUOUS and FREE (unused) when Windows 9x starts, and that EMM386.EXE does
NOT load from CONFIG.SYS.
Note that EMM386.EXE settings in CONFIG.SYS take precedence over the
SYSTEM.INI lines. If EMM386.EXE is set to provide expanded memory (EMS) with
the "RAM" or "HIGHSCAN" switch in CONFIG.SYS, the SYSTEM.INI line above has
NO effect.
Use this workaround ONLY IF you have ANY DOS based programs/games that need
EMS to run in a DOS box/session.

Alternatively you can disable the Windows 9x search for free (unused) RAM in
the UMA, by adding/changing this line under the [386enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI, to avoid incompatibilities with DOS mode drivers/TSRs or/and 3rd
party upper/extended/expanded memory managers loaded from your startup files
(CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT):

[386enh]
EMMExclude=A000-FFFF

ADDITIONAL OS COMPATIBILITY
===========================

Begining with v3.00 UMBPCI is compatible with DR-DOS, Novell DOS and Caldera
Open DOS.

When UMBPCI doesn't find an XMS driver (i.e. HIMEM.SYS), it only enables
(maps) the upper memory and ends. HIDOS.SYS can then create UMBs from this
memory.

Use is like this:

device=c:\umbpci\umbpci.sys
device=himem.sys /chipset=ram /use=c800-efff

The /use parameter of himem should set the same areas that UMBPCI
reports when it loads. Best you test it before with UMBCHK.
